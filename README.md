Music Mash-Up is a web application wich grabs 3 audio files from the user and mashes the songs together to creat a new audio file. The user can than listen to the mix of their three audio choices. 

The connect.py does runs but there is a problem with the html and a python file connection. 
If only proj2.html is opened without using connect, it loads an audio. 
There was a bug with the src of the audio, it grabs the correct path, but it doesnâ€™t load into html tag for that reason the files are already loaded and only work if the file is running. 
Python code apart for html does run. Using audio was the problem. 
Songs do mix into one song using beats.py which uses pydub library. 
All songs need to be in the same file in order for beats.py to run. 
The main bug was connecting html and python library else everything else works accordingly.
